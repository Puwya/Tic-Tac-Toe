This is a very basic Tic Tac Toe clone it is my first project ever, excuse the intense amount of if loops used.

I will update it as I learn more "Maybe" just because I do want to see how much I improve anyways if anyone does end up going through it.

Give me some advice on what I could have done better.

After making this project I went to youtube to find out what different ways people made a Tic Tac Toe clone VERY insightful, like using a multi dimensional vector!
